Environmental problems are currently one of the most contested policy area in United States.
Political polarization of public attitude between Republicans and Democrats on climate change represents this contestation.
This partisan gap on climate change has become vastly wide over time. In 1989, the gap was virtually non-existent between Republicans and Democrats (cite). In March 2017 Gallup poll, it had grown to a 48-percentage point difference (Democrats: 66% concerned vs. Republicans: 18% concerned). This is especially puzzling because the increased partisan gap has coexisted with the growing consensus in scientific community about anthropogenic climate change. (기존 연구의 한계가 빠져 있음). This paper focuses on modeling and exploring two different mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the political polarization of the public’s attitude on climate change using agent-based modeling.
